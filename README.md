## Packages

### `Material ui`

Material-UI is simply a library that allows us to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications. This saves a significant amount of time since the developers do not need to write everything from scratch.


### `d3`

D3 is simply helps to react the Csv data and later we can use same library to statistical view of data if required.

### `Typescript`

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. It helps the developer to highlight the errors as early as possible.

### `gh-pages`

use github to version control and submit the code. Github-pages will make easiler to deploy the site.

Potentional Improvement: 

We can add `Redux` on this project.
We can try to improve project and code structure if more time given.
We can add CI/CD part on the project, so whenever there is new commit it will start showing on site.

Assumptions:

We have assumed that `State Management` is not required for this project.
I have used Short form of Service Type. Please do let me know the full forms of each service type if required.
